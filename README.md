From the perspective of the public opinion, any corruption is against the public well-being. However, an opposite hypothesis argues that corruption may expedite the economic growth by facilitating business to bypass bureaucratic obstacles in trade and production. In this research project, I utilize multiple quantitative methods to detect the potentials non-linear effect of corruption on economic development and test if corruption is able to lubricate the growth at a certain stage of economic development. The result from the analysis is able to guide the policymakers to allocate reasonable resources to the enforcement of anti-corruption laws. I use country-level gross income as the dependent variable and corruption index as the independent variable. In order to control different stages of economic development, I also incorporate democracy, education attainment, urbanization, rule of law and income inequality into my model. I collect the data of these variables from the World Bank, the United Nation and the Freedom House. And the dataset consists of the data of 160 countries and territories from 2010 to 2017. Due to the cross-sectional and longitudinal property of the dataset, I will estimate the coefficients of the variables using panel data method in R.
